      Work and labour is important for those who need money to survive, but the executives profit off of your time and labour.
      
      On average 10 full years of your life is wasted working 24/7, dedicated towards your career and labour.
      
      That is roughly 90,000 hours of work it’s insane to believe this much time of your life is wasted. 
      
      The saying “Time is money.” is 100% true and correct, because your time is the most valuable thing in existence.
      
      It’s worth millions, maybe even billions. But that’s all just locked potential,
      
      If you manage to unlock that potential than your life will significantly improve. 
      
      The game of life is like a gamble for the most financial freedom.
      
      Never forget your faith in the creator because the real happiness also lies within our faith.
